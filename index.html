    <h1>Gnomes R Us</h1>
    <p id="middle-paragraph">
      As of recently, the gnome conspirators have found ways to prevent us from taking their socks. This cannot be allowed to stand. 
      As such, our researchers have been working tirelessly to fight back against these unethical defenses. 
      If you or your loved ones have found yourself victim to these atrocities, here is how you can get rid of them for good!

        <h2>The Forsaken Boots</h2>
          <p class="p-class">
            The Forsaken boots of lost comfort remove the softness of the socks we love so much. Against such a foe, it seems nigh impossible to get the socks.
             Luckily, there is a solution. A group of gnomes have learned the art of shoe making thanks to a human imbecile. We can make the boots comfortable while they sleep.
