    <h1>Gnomes R Us</h1>
    <p id="middle-paragraph">
      As of recently, the gnome conspirators have found ways to prevent us from taking their socks. This cannot be allowed to stand. 
      As such, our researchers have been working tirelessly to fight back against these unethical defenses. 
      If you or your loved ones have found yourself victim to these atrocities, here is how you can get rid of them for good!

        <h2>The Forsaken Boots</h2>
          <p class="p-class">
            The Forsaken boots of lost comfort remove the softness of the socks we love so much. Against such a foe, it seems nigh impossible to get the socks.
             Luckily, there is a solution. A group of gnomes have learned the art of shoe making thanks to a human imbecile. We can make the boots comfortable while they sleep.

        <h2>The Dreaded Locks</h2>
          <p class="p-class">
            The dreaded locks of locking seem to be an impassible obstacle into the humans supply of socks. However, one of our researchers with a keen eye saw the solution right in front of him.
            Humans cannot be bothered to remember which lock is the correct one, nor do they have the time to sort through their boundless key rings.
            The humans have secretly marked their keys through some means. Once you figure it out, the dreaded locks will have been... unlocked.

        <h2>The Merciless Dragon</h2>
          <p class="p-class">
            The merciless dragon destroy's all who dare enter its territory uninvited. Countless of our brethren have fallen by the talon's of this fiendish creature.
            Out of the 3 defenses, the lizard is by far the worst and most terrifying defense to lays eyes on. What can we possibly do to defeat this menace once and for all!
            Well, our researches have had a breakthrough! We now know once and for all how to defeat this creature of mass destruction!
            All you have to do, is not go into its lair. The creatures rarely come out of their lair. Simply go about your business and avoid the lair.
            I know that it seems terrifying to show your back to the creature, but it is the only solution that we have found so far.
